# TODO: Multiple Things
- PronunciationAssessment does not work correctly when the Audiofile is
    (way) longer than the reference text; maybe also use Google 
    and when it is longer than the reference text it uses a different approach

- Make it possible to re-record the audio
- add random sentence generator icon and backend functionality
